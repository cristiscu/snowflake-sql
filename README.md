# Snowflake SQL

All demo source code for my Udemy course **Improvements to Snowflake SQL Masterclass Hands-On**.

![logo](.images/logo.png)

To use this repo with my course, you can clone it and open it locally with VS Code. Then, for each lecture, locate the demo files by looking at the section and the specific SQL file. Copy and paste that file in a SQL worksheet in Snowsight, rather then running it from within VS Code.

I used number prefixes to make it easier to locate both the section and the lecture.
